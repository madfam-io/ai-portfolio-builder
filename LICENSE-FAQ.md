# MADFAM Code Available License (MCAL) - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Q: What is the MADFAM Code Available License?
**A**: The MCAL is a proprietary license that allows viewing and studying our source code for educational purposes while prohibiting commercial use without explicit permission from MADFAM.

### Q: Is this open source?
**A**: No. This is a "code available" license, not open source. While you can view and study the code, you cannot use it commercially or redistribute it. Open source licenses allow commercial use and redistribution, which MCAL explicitly prohibits.

### Q: Why make the code available if it's not open source?
**A**: We believe in transparency and education. Developers can learn from our implementation, evaluate our security practices, and understand how we build our products. This builds trust while protecting our business interests.

## Usage Rights

**A**: Yes, you can run and modify the software for non-commercial, personal use on your own devices. This includes learning, experimentation, and personal portfolio websites that don't generate revenue.

### Q: Can I use this code for my freelance business?
**A**: No. Any business use, including freelance work, requires a commercial license. Contact licensing@madfam.com for options.

### Q: Can I use this code in my company?
**A**: No. Corporate use of any kind requires a commercial license, even for internal tools or proof-of-concepts.

**A**: Only for personal, non-commercial use. The extracted code remains under MCAL terms. For commercial use of any code portion, you need a license.
