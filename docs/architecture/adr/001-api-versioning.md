# ADR-001: API Versioning Strategy

**Date**: June 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: PRISMA Development Team

## Context

As PRISMA evolves, we need a clear strategy for API versioning to ensure:

- Backward compatibility for existing integrations
- Clear deprecation paths
- Support for multiple API versions simultaneously
- Developer-friendly migration paths

## Decision

We will implement explicit URL-based API versioning with the following structure:

- All API routes will be prefixed with `/api/v{version}/`
- Version 1 will be `/api/v1/`
- Legacy routes without version will redirect to v1 with deprecation warnings
- Version headers (`API-Version: v1`) will be supported for future flexibility

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// API Structure
app/api/v1/
├── portfolios/
├── ai/
│   ├── enhance-bio/
│   ├── optimize-project/
│   └── recommend-template/
├── analytics/
└── experiments/
```

### Deprecation Policy

- 6 months notice before version sunset
- Clear migration guides provided
- Deprecation warnings in responses
- Support for at least 2 major versions concurrently

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear versioning makes API evolution predictable
- Clients can migrate at their own pace
- Breaking changes can be introduced safely
- Better developer experience with clear documentation

### Negative

- Increased maintenance burden supporting multiple versions
- More complex routing and middleware
- Potential code duplication between versions

### Neutral

- Standard practice in REST API design
- Aligns with industry best practices
