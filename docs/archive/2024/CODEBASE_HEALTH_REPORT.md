   - 318 tests still failing
   - Focus on API route tests
   - Complete store test fixes

2. **ESLint Compliance**

   - 235 violations remaining
   - Max nested callbacks issues
   - Complexity violations in key files

3. **Code Organization**
   - Several files >500 lines need splitting
   - app/demo/interactive/page.tsx (857 lines)
   - Refactor complex components

### Medium Priority

1. **Documentation**

   - Update API documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments
   - Create testing guide

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement request caching
   - Optimize image loading
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add input sanitization
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Security headers configuration

## Next Steps (Phase 2 - Code Quality)

### Week 2 Goals

1. **ESLint Compliance** (Target: 0 violations)

   - Fix max-nested-callbacks
   - Reduce cyclomatic complexity
   - Apply consistent formatting

2. **Test Suite** (Target: 95% passing)

   - Fix remaining 318 tests
   - Add missing test cases
   - Improve test performance

3. **Refactoring** (Target: All files <500 lines)
   - Split large components
   - Extract utility functions
   - Improve code organization

## Risk Assessment

### ‚úÖ Resolved Risks

- Production build failures
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Critical runtime errors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Risks

- **Medium**: Test coverage gaps could hide bugs
- **Low**: ESLint violations affect maintainability
- **Low**: Large files impact developer experience

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Complete test suite fixes
   - Address ESLint violations
   - Refactor large files

2. **Short Term** (1-2 weeks):

   - Achieve 95% test pass rate
   - Full ESLint compliance
   - Complete documentation

3. **Long Term** (1 month):
   - 100% test coverage for critical paths
   - Performance monitoring dashboard
   - Automated quality gates

## Progress Tracking
