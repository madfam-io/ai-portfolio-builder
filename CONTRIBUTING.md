   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub
   # Clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-portfolio-builder.git
   cd ai-portfolio-builder
   ```

2. **Set Up Git**

   git remote add upstream https://github.com/aldoruizluna/labspace/ai-portfolio-builder.git

   # Configure Git
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Docker Development (Recommended)

For full-stack development with database and caching:

```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/docker-dev.sh

# Services available:
# App: http://localhost:3000
# pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050
# PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
# Redis: localhost:6379
```

### Local Development

For frontend-only development:

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Check types
pnpm type-check
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```env
# Copy from .env.example
cp .env.example .env.local

# Add your API keys (optional for basic features)
```

## üí° How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

1. **üêõ Bug Fixes**

   - Check existing [issues](https://github.com/aldoruizluna/labspace/ai-portfolio-builder/issues)
   - Create a test that reproduces the bug
   - Fix the bug and ensure all tests pass

2. **‚ú® New Features**

   - Check the [roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md) for planned features
   - Discuss major features in an issue first
   - Follow the existing code patterns

3. **üìö Documentation**

   - Improve existing documentation
   - Add missing documentation
   - Fix typos and clarify confusing sections

4. **üß™ Tests**

   - Add missing tests
   - Improve test coverage
   - Fix flaky tests

5. **üé® UI/UX Improvements**

   - Follow the existing design system
   - Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers

6. **üåç Translations**
   - Add missing translation keys
   - Improve existing translations
   - Maintain consistency across languages

## üìè Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict Mode**: All code must pass TypeScript strict mode
- **No `any`**: Avoid using `any` type
- **Interfaces**: Define interfaces for all data structures
- **Type Safety**: Ensure complete type coverage

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// ‚ùå Bad
const user: any = { name: 'John' };
```

### React Components

- **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Props Interfaces**: Define props interfaces for all components
- **Component Organization**: Keep components focused and modular

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export function Button({ onClick, children, variant = 'primary' }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={cn('btn', `btn-${variant}`)}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### File Organization

- **File Size**: Keep files under 500 lines
- **Single Responsibility**: One component/function per file
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Use Tailwind utility classes
- **Custom CSS**: Use CSS modules for complex styles
- **Dark Mode**: Ensure all components support dark mode
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach

### Internationalization

- **No Hardcoded Text**: All user-facing text must use translations
- **Translation Keys**: Use descriptive, hierarchical keys

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
const { t } = useLanguage();
return <h1>{t.dashboard.title}</h1>;

// ‚ùå Bad
return <h1>Dashboard</h1>;
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- **New Features**: Must include tests
- **Bug Fixes**: Must include a test that reproduces the bug
- **Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ coverage on critical paths

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should handle user interactions', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<Component />);

    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e
```
